# Mission [0]: [Monorepo Foundations]

## DevLog: [2025-06-28]

### Focus for Today:
- Create GitHub repository
- Understand how to install and use Pants initially (Via WSL as recommended)
- Create initial folder stucture and first DevLog

### Key Learnings & Discoveries:
- I understood how to install and use Pants in WSL
- I also learned how to setup SysLink from WSL to Windows and one of its uses
- I created my first DevLog and grasped on its template

### Challenges Faced:
- When trying to use a custom SSH profile via SysLink from WSL, I was left with some permission errors when using git commands

### Solutions & Overcomes:
- My first atempt was to change the permission of each file, which at first seems to work, but at the end it didn't
- As a work-around, I copied all the content of .ssh dir from windows to WSL and it worked flawlesly


### AI Tools Used (and how):
- I used Gemini to help me understand the nuances of using WLS and why should I do it for this project specifically
- It also helped me get to work and plan each step I should take to start my journey

### Next Steps:
- Finish setup Pants and the folder structure
- Start creating some Python and JS boilerplates project
